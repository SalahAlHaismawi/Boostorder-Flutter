### Explanation:

- **Features**:
  1. **RESTful API Integration**: The app fetches product data from a remote server using a RESTful API.
  2. **Offline Functionality**: Products are stored locally using SQLite to ensure the app can function without an internet connection.
  3. **Cart Functionality**: Users can add products to a cart, view the cart, and clear the cart.

- **Getting Started**: Instructions for setting up and running the project.

- **Project Architecture**:
  - **Models**: Contains the data models for the application (e.g., `Product` and `CartItem`).
  - **Screens**: Contains the UI components (views) of the application (e.g., `CatalogScreen` and `CartScreen`).
  - **Services**: Handles API calls and database interactions (e.g., `LocalStorageService`).
